# GogEngine
Gog Engine is a Completely Open-Source, lightweight, Python-Based text editor / Game Engine.
In later development stages, Gog Engine will feature my very own Python-Based programming language (.psu)

# Why GogEngine?
Gog Engine is a great option for python developers. It's extremely lightweight, everything is Open-Source, so you do
not have to worry about what you're really getting into, and It's easy to use! All of GogEngine is programmed
without the use of external Libraries such as PyGame. GogEngine was strictly programmed using Tkinter,
as well as other libraries which are already implemented into your base Python Installation.

# What To Expect?
The future of Gog Engine holds many possibilities. Currently, Gog Engine is only available for Windows users,
however a linux build is 100% possible for the future. The implementation of my very own programming language
pseudoscript, is currently in the works and will not be implemented with the BETA release of Gog Engine.

# How Do I Install Gog Engine?
Instructions on how to install Gog Engine will be added to this .README file in the future.
As of writing this, the BETA release of Gog Engine is STILL in the works. I had already programmed a previous
version of Gog Engine, using EXTERNAL Libraries which is not something I want to work with.
Programming while only using INTERNAL libraries included with Python is great for many reasons that I will not yap about.

# Want to Support Gog Engine?
